# Online Shopper's Purchasing Intention Prediction



This repository contains the code for a research project aimed at predicting online shopping sessions that lead to a purchase and identifying the parameters contributing to this action. The project makes use of the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset from UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository. The source of this data is from Istanbul, Turkey.

## Dataset Information

The Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset contains information on online shopping sessions from a specific shop. The major goal of the data collection is to forecast the purchase intentions of a website visitor to this specific shop. To eliminate any inclination to a single campaign, special day, user profile, or era, the data set was constructed so that each session belonged to a distinct user across a one-year period. Based on inference, this dataset contains no missing values and all attributes are related to purchase intention.

## Research Goals

The main goal of this research project is to predict online shopping sessions that lead to a purchase and identify the parameters contributing to this action. To achieve this, we will use machine learning techniques to build models that can accurately predict purchase intention based on user behavior and other attributes.

## Methodology

We will follow a standard machine learning pipeline to build our predictive models. This pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: We will clean and preprocess the dataset to remove any noise, inconsistencies, or missing values. We will also perform feature engineering to create new features that can improve the predictive power of our models.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: We will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify patterns, trends, and correlations that can guide our feature selection and modeling decisions.

3. Model Selection: We will experiment with different machine learning algorithms and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We will also use cross-validation and grid search techniques to fine-tune the hyperparameters of our models.

4. Model Evaluation: We will evaluate the performance of our models on a holdout test set and compare their performance to baseline models and other state-of-the-art models in the literature.

5. Model Interpretation: We will use model interpretability techniques such as feature importance analysis and partial dependence plots to identify the parameters contributing to purchase intention and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms driving user behavior.

## Conclusion

This research project aims to predict online shopping sessions that lead to a purchase and identify the parameters contributing to this action. By using machine learning techniques and the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention dataset, we hope to contribute to the growing body of research in the field of e-commerce and provide insights into the behavior of online shoppers.
